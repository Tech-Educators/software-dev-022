// Get all of our messages
// We'll create an async function and use fetch() to get them
// Once we have our array of message objects, we'll loop thrugh them and display on the page


// Users should be able to fill in a form and make a new message

// Create a form in our index.html | Remember to add your 'name' attribute (give it the same name as your columns in your database). 

// Event listenger for form submision
// Get the values from the form (2 weird lines)
// use fetch() to send a post request, seind the values from the form in the body. 

// Maybe we could re-run the fetch function to re-display our messages with the new one included.
