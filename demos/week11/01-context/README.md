# Context

## Use case:

- We want to implement different themes in our app (light, dark, colourblind-friendly, dyslexia-friendly...)
- We want themes to be available in the whole app, and also be added to future components

## Tool:

- Context to provide the themes to our components in an efficient way

## Step 1

- Set up your context in a separate file in the context folder

## Step 2 (optional)

- Set up a Providers file to organise your context(s)

## Step 3

- Use our Providers function in our layout to provide context to our app

## Step 4

- Use your context wherever it is needed
